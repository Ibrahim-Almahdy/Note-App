# Note Taking Application

A modern, fully responsive web application designed for managing daily tasks and notes efficiently. The application features a split-view interface that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

## Project Description

This project is a fully functional Single Page Application (SPA) built using Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes (CRUD operations). The application utilizes the browser's LocalStorage API to ensure data persistence, meaning users will not lose their data upon refreshing or closing the page.

## Key Features

- **Fully Responsive Design:** Optimized layout that automatically adjusts for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Split-View Layout:** A user-friendly interface with a sidebar for navigation and a main area for content editing.
- **Data Persistence:** Automatically saves all notes and changes to LocalStorage.
- **Task Management:** Checkbox functionality in the sidebar to mark tasks as completed without opening them.
- **CRUD Functionality:** Full capability to add new notes, edit existing ones, and delete unwanted items.
- **Dynamic Interface:** Features a Floating Action Button for quick addition and smart empty-state handling.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling, Flexbox layout, and Media Queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For application logic, DOM manipulation, and state management.
