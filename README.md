# Note Taking Application

A modern, responsive web application designed for managing daily tasks and notes efficiently. The application features a split-view interface, separating the navigation list from the editing area, similar to desktop productivity software.

## Project Description

This project is a fully functional Single Page Application (SPA) built using Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes (CRUD operations). The application utilizes the browser's LocalStorage API to ensure data persistence, meaning users will not lose their data upon refreshing or closing the page.

## Key Features

- **Split-View Layout:** A user-friendly interface with a sidebar for navigation and a main area for content editing.
- **Data Persistence:** Automatically saves all notes and changes to LocalStorage.
- **Task Management:** Checkbox functionality in the sidebar to mark tasks as completed without opening them.
- **CRUD Functionality:** Full capability to add new notes, edit existing ones, and delete unwanted items.
- **Dynamic Interface:**
  - Floating Action Button for quick addition.
  - Smart empty-state handling when no notes are selected.
  - Hidden scrollbars for a cleaner visual experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox), and CSS Variables.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For application logic, DOM manipulation, and state management.
